PSO algorithm

based on behaviour of manadas. It is a otimization algorithm.

Starts with a population. Each individual has a position and a velocity.

1. Evaluate fitness function (aptidao) for each individuo

2. find the pBest - > Best position until the moment.

3. Find gBest -> Best individuo of bando.

4. Update speed of each particle.


phi1 = random(0:1)*cte1 -> constant responsible to individual part
phi2 = random(0:1)*cte2 -> constant responsible to group part

The higher the constants are, grater the influence it will cause in new velocity
and hence in new position of the particles.

nVel = cVel = (pBest - pCurr)*ph1 + (gBest - pCurr)*phi2 
	individual		group

nPos = cPos + nVel
