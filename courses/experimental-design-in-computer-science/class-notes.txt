- Caracteriscts and differences between z and t tests:
Both are statistical tests for testing a hipothesis. 
The main difference is that the z-test is used to compare
a data point, for instance, the mean of the sample, based on
the standard deviation (large sample size > 30), and its based
on normal distribution. The t-test is more commonly used to 
compare the averages of two samples, where the standar deviation 
or variance is unknown (small sample size < 30), and its based
on t-student distribution.

- Assumption of Independence:
Many statistical tests is based on assumption that the data is 
independent. This means that a data point should not have a
connection with another data point. An example is the amount of 
money which a person earns related to what it eat in breakfest.
Experimental conditions of all observations are exactly the same.

- Power of a experiment:

- Pre-registered experiment:
Its an strategy to register the methodology, kind of analysis, 
and some other techniques that will be used in the experiment 
before it is conducted.
To guide the steps of the experiment.
Avoid forget the main objective of the experiment.
A better structure to performing the experiment and plan it.
Reduce the effect of human bias.
