## The Experiment^[Adapted from R.F.O. Costa's course project for the Design and Analysis of Experiments Course, PPGEE-UFMG, June 2012. The data used in this case study is not the original one.]

According to Brazilian regulation agency ANATEL, the average download speed can be considered in conformity with the contracted value as long as it is superior to 60% of the nominal value. In this case study, we wish to investigate whether a given provider is fulfilling this condition in a 10MBps residential connection.

Twenty measurements of download speed were collected using [SpeedTest](http://www.speedtest.net/) under homogeneous usage conditions (same computer, same browser, automatic update services disabled, no other software being used besides the browser). The collected data is available in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/fcampelo/Design-and-Analysis-of-Experiments/tree/master/data%20files).


## Activities

Your task is to analyze this experimental data in order to answer the following question: 

\begin{center}\textit{Is the actual average download speed in accordance with the regulations?}\end{center} 

Your analysis should include:

- Definition of the test hypotheses;
- Test of the hypotheses;
- Estimation of the effect size and confidence interval on the relevant value;
- Verification of the assumptions of the test;
- Drawing of conclusions and recommendations.

Remember that your conclusions should always be placed in the context of the original technical/scientific question.

## Report
You must deliver a short report detailing your analysis and the results obtained.  Instructions for writing your report depend on the course you're taking, and are given below:

### 1) For graduate (PPGEE) Students
Your report will be evaluated according to:

- Compliance with the required format (see below);
- Reproducibility of results;
- Technical correctness;
- Structure of argumentation;
- Correct use of language (grammar, orthography, etc.);

The report **must** be produced using [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com), and should contain the reproducible analysis code embedded as code blocks within the document. Please send me only the **.Rmd** file (the analysis should assume that the data file is in the same directory as the report file). A template for the case study reports is available in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/fcampelo/Design-and-Analysis-of-Experiments/tree/master/Report%20template).

Reports written in either Portuguese, English, or Spanish will be accepted.


### For undergrad (Systems Engineering) Students
Your report will be evaluated according to:

- Technical correctness;
- Correct use of language (grammar, orthography, etc.);

The report has no particular template. [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) is suggested, but not mandatory. Please send me the **.pdf** file (**NO** .doc, .odt, or other exotic formats please) and the **.R** analysis file.
