Here are examples of reports that got high grades in the last (and most difficult) case study. Both examples are in Portuguese, since we did not have anyone submitting their reports in English this term.

Please notice that while these reports are not perfect (there are still a few mistakes here and there in the analysis and interpretation) they are mostly correct and, very importantly, demonstrate the efforts of their authors in thinking and working on the problem. 

Notice that the main aspects of the study (definition of the problem, sample size estimation, data gathering, exploratory data analysis, statistical modelling, model validation and derivation of conclusions) were all covered. Moreover, the authors had a proactive attitude, looking for alternative answers outside the regular course materials.

I hope you find these examples useful.
